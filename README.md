## 🎮 Who I Am

French systems developer specializing in Unreal Engine and C++ gameplay architecture.
I focus on building technical foundations — frameworks, tools, and engine-level features that scale.

My goal is straightforward: master Unreal Engine at a deep level and shape a future in GameTech engineering and solo-founded tools & engines. I build fast, iterate constantly, and keep a sharp eye on clean design patterns.
Let’s connect — especially if you're into **game tech**, **tools**, or **engine-level systems**.


## 🔥 Current Focus: Unreal Engine

Right now, Unreal Engine is the core of everything I do.

### 🧩 Engine-Level Workflows

- C++ gameplay systems
- Custom components and modules
- Data-driven logic setups
- Engine features exploration
- Optimization, debugging, iteration

### 🛠 Gameplay Architecture

- State machines
- Event-driven logic
- Input workflows
- Movement systems
- Reusable gameplay modules

### 🗂 Project Direction

- Developing a personal Unreal sandbox to test systems
- Deepening expertise in engine internals
- Building foundations for future tools and technical products



### 🧠 How I Work

- Systems-first, engine-aware mindset
- Strong emphasis on clean architecture
- Rapid iteration with structured refactoring
- Reusable solutions rather than one-shot features
- Product-driven approach: build for scalability and clarity
